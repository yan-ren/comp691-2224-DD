<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is COMP 691 – Online Algorithms and Competitive Analysis, Winter 2023 course project. This repository presents the results of a study based on the paper ”Coloring Inductive Graphs On-Line” by Sandy Irani, which examines the First Fit online graph coloring algorithm in the context of d-inductive graphs.

### Built With
* [![Python][Python]][Python-url]
* [![Matplotlib][Matplotlib]][Matplotlib-url]
* [![NetworkX][NetworkX]][NetworkX-url]


## Repository Structure
* main_v1.py - Implement the experiments used in the report, using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
* main_v2.py - Implement the experiments used in the report, using self-created Graph class and Matplotlib.
> Note: main_v1.py and main_v2.py implement the same experiment and have the same results, the only difference is main_v1.py is implemented with third-party libraries, whereas main_v2.py is not. The plots used in the report is collected by main_v1.py. 
* color_dict.json - Color dictionary with 10,000 labeled colors and hexdecimal color code, generated by util.py.
* util.py - Utility functions.
